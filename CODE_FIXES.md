# Code Fixes and Project Setup

This document provides instructions for fixing issues identified in the project codebase and setting up the environment properly.

## Dependencies Installation

Run one of the following scripts based on your operating system:

### Windows
```
# Using PowerShell
.\install_dependencies.ps1

# OR using Command Prompt
install_dependencies.bat
```

### macOS/Linux
```
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

## Fixed Issues

1. **Import Path Issues**
   - Updated all imports from `improved_models_fixed` to `improved_models` since the file `improved_models_fixed.py` was only in the archive directory
   - Fixed imports in:
     - `advanced_training.py`
     - `comprehensive_mixer.py`
     - `ensemble_training.py`
     - `final_ensemble_training.py`
     - `efficient_enhanced_training.py`

2. **Signal Processing Code**
   - Updated filter implementation in `ai_mixer.py` and `comprehensive_mixer.py`
   - Changed from `signal.iirfilter` with `b, a` coefficients to `signal.butter` with second-order sections (`sos`)
   - Fixed the filter application using `sosfilt` instead of `filtfilt`

3. **Audio Processing Dependencies**
   - Added `torchaudio` to requirements.txt
   - Implemented custom frequency and time masking functions in `improved_models.py`

4. **Variable Initialization**
   - Fixed unbound variable issues in `advanced_training.py` and `ensemble_training.py`

## Known Remaining Issues

1. **Indentation Issues in `comprehensive_mixer.py`**
   - There are still some indentation issues in this file
   - Fix by ensuring consistent indentation throughout the file (4 spaces per level)

2. **Runtime Dependencies**
   - Libraries like `librosa` and `soundfile` need to be installed
   - Running the provided installation scripts should resolve these issues

3. **Signal Processing Warnings**
   - Some type checking warnings may still appear for signal processing code
   - These should not affect runtime functionality

## Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies using the provided scripts
2. Run one of the demo scripts to test the AI mixing functionality:
   ```
   python demo_ai_mixer.py
   ```
3. For more advanced usage, refer to the project documentation
