# Deployment-Ready Models

This directory contains models optimized for deployment on cloud platforms like Render.com.

## Models Summary

The following models have been processed and are ready for deployment:

| Model Name | Size | Status |
|------------|------|--------|
| baseline_cnn | 4.88 MB | ✅ Ready |
| enhanced_cnn | 11.66 MB | ✅ Ready |
| improved_baseline_cnn | 4.88 MB | ✅ Ready |
| improved_enhanced_cnn | 3.08 MB | ✅ Ready |
| retrained_enhanced_cnn | 11.66 MB | ✅ Ready |
| weighted_ensemble | 36.16 MB | ✅ Ready |

## Deployment Considerations

### Direct Deployment (Current Approach)
All models are under 50MB and can be deployed directly with your application on Render.com's free tier.

### Alternative: External Storage
For future larger models, consider:
- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Hugging Face Model Hub

### Loading Models in Your Application

When loading models in your application, use the environment variable `MODELS_DIR` to locate these files:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import torch

models_dir = os.environ.get("MODELS_DIR", "../models/deployment")
model_path = Path(models_dir) / "model_name.pth"

# Load the model
model = YourModelClass()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
```

## Configuration

The `model_info.json` file contains metadata about all models, including their sizes and deployment strategies.

## Verification

After deployment, use the `verify_render_deployment.py` script to ensure models are loading correctly on your Render instance.
