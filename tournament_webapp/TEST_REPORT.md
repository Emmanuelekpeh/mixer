# 🎭 Playwright Test Report

## Summary
Playwright UI testing has been successfully set up for your Tournament Webapp and has identified several key issues.

## ✅ What's Working
- **Frontend loads successfully** on all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile)
- **Basic UI elements are present**: Artist name input, file upload, start button
- **Navigation works** between Home and Leaderboard
- **Backend server is running** on port 10000
- **Frontend server is running** on port 3000

## ❌ Issues Identified

### 1. API Routing Problems
- **Models endpoint returns 404**: `GET /models` → 404 Not Found
- **No API calls from frontend**: The React app isn't making any API calls to the backend
- **Missing API endpoints**: Several expected endpoints are not being accessed

### 2. Model Loading Issues (From Server Logs)
- **Path resolution error**: `Models directory not found: ../models`
- **Working directory issue**: When running from `tournament_webapp/backend`, the relative path `../models` resolves incorrectly
- **Should be**: Absolute path or correct relative path to the models directory

### 3. Tournament Deletion Feature Missing
- **No delete buttons found** in any UI elements
- **No tournament management interface** discovered
- **Confirms user report**: "Can't delete sustained tournaments"

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: API Routing
```javascript
// In tournament_api.py, add missing endpoints:
@app.get("/models")
async def get_models():
    return {"models": list(tournament_engine.get_available_models())}

@app.get("/api/models") 
async def get_api_models():
    return await get_models()
```

### Fix 2: Model Path Resolution
```python
# In simplified_tournament_engine.py, fix model path:
def load_real_models(self):
    # Change from:
    models_dir = "../models"  # ❌ Relative path fails
    
    # Change to:
    models_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../../models"))
    # OR
    models_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "models"
```

### Fix 3: Add Tournament Deletion
```javascript
// Add delete button to tournament components
<button onClick={() => deleteTournament(tournament.id)}>
  Delete Tournament
</button>

// Add API endpoint:
@app.delete("/tournaments/{tournament_id}")
async def delete_tournament(tournament_id: str):
    return await tournament_engine.delete_tournament(tournament_id)
```

- ✅ Firefox (Desktop) 
- ✅ Safari (Desktop)
- ✅ Chrome (Mobile)
- ✅ Safari (Mobile)

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Fix API routing** - Add missing `/models` endpoint
2. **Fix model path** - Use absolute path for model directory
3. **Add deletion feature** - Implement tournament deletion UI and API
4. **Test fixes** - Re-run tests after implementing fixes
5. **Expand tests** - Add more specific test cases as needed
