- **Blocking Dependencies**: Have alternative approaches ready
- **Integration Issues**: Test integration points early and often

### Quality Risks
- **Insufficient Testing**: Write tests as you implement features
- **User Experience**: Get feedback early on UI/UX changes
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor performance metrics throughout
